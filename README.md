### Dependencies ###

This component depends on **JQuery**, Ionic and Angular

## How to use ###

1) Install using bower or npm

```
    bower i datepicker-for-ionic --save
    npm i datepicker-for-ionic --save
```

2) Then you can see the following directory structure see in your project folder

Give the path of  `style.css, templates.min.js and ionic-datepicker.min.js` in your `index.html` file.

````html
<script src="lib/ionic-datepicker/dist/ionic-datepicker.bundle.min.js"></script>
````    
    
3) In your application module inject the dependency `ionic-datepicker`, in order to work with the ionic time picker
````javascript
angular.module('mainModuleName', ['ionic', 'ionic-datepicker']){
 //
}
````

4) Use the below format in your template's corresponding controller

````javascript
$scope.currentDate = new Date();
$scope.minDate = new Date(2105, 6, 1);
$scope.maxDate = new Date(2015, 6, 31);

$scope.datePickerCallback = function (val) {
	if (!val) {	
		console.log('Date not selected');
	} else {
		console.log('Selected date is : ', val);
	}
};
````

a) `currentDate` is the date object which we are passing to the `ionic-datepicker`.

b) `minDate` is minimum date that user is allowed to select.

c) `maxDate` is maximum date that user is allowed to select.

d) `datePickerCallback` is the callback function which we have to pass to the `ionic-datepicker`. This function takes an argument which will return `undefined` if the user didnot selected any date. And returns a `date` object, if the user selects any date.


5) Then use the below format in your template / html file

````html
<ionic-datepicker date="currentDate" min="minDate" max="maxDate" callback="datePickerCallback">
    <button class="button button-block button-positive"> {{ currentDate | date:'MMMM/dd/yyyy' }} </button>
</ionic-datepicker>
````


a) `ionic-datepicker` is the directive, to which we can pass required vales.

b) `date` takes date object. If we don't pass any value, the default value will be `new Date()`.

c) `min` takes date object. Pass only if you want to restrict date.

d) `max` takes date object. Pass only if you want to restrict date.

e) `callback` takes the callback function name which will be called once the date picker has been closed.
